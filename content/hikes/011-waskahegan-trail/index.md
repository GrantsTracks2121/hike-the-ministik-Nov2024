## Description

This "2-Car" hike takes place exclusively on the Waskahegan Trail, the only trail in the Ministik that has trail markings and receives periodic maintenance. There are a couple of rough sections, and it's relatively long at 13 km, earning it an "Expedition" rating on this site.

The directions for this "2-Car" hike assume you'll start at U of A Field Station Access Road Gate and walk to the Fairbrother Corner Trailhead. Of course you could do the hike in reverse; your choice.
