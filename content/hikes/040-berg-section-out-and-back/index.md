summary: "This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as \"Moderate\" because it's a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit \"Berg Stopover\", a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers. The hike is \"out and back\" so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started."

## Description

This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as "Moderate" because it's a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit "Berg Stopover", a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers.

The hike is "out and back" so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started.




{{< notice tip >}}
There are sections of this hike where scratchy bushes beside the trail grow over the trail. Long sleeves and long pants are highly recommended for this hike.
