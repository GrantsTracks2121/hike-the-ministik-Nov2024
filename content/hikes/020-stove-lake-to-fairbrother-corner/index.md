## Description

This hike rates as "Expedition" for a reason: it's just about 13 km and covers a good portion of the Ministik. It's a convenient "2-Car" option though: the departure and destination trailhead are along the same country road.

The directions for this "2-Car" hike assume you'll start at Stove Lake Trailhead and walk to the Fairbrother Corner Trailhead. Of course you could do the hike in reverse; your choice.
