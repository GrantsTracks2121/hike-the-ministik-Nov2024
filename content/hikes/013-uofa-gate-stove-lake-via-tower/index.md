## Description

At almost 10 km, this "2-Car" hike will test your stamina, but the trails themselves should be easy to follow throughout. After spending the first half on the Waskahegan Trail, you transition to a former cutline that is often traversed by sleds in the winter, making it fairly easy to follow.

The directions for this "2-Car" hike assume you'll start at U of A Field Station Access Road Gate and walk to the Stove Lake Trailhead. Of course you could do the hike in reverse; your choice.
