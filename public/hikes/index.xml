      <description>Starting from the U of A Access Road Gate, this hike traverses sections of the established Waskahegan Trail as well as a series of five &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows on a wide loop that takes you into the inner depths of the Ministik, eventually passing the Ministik Firetower.</description>

      <description>Starting from the Francis Edward Williams trailhead, this hike traverses sections of the established Waskahegan Trail as well as a series of five &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows on a wide loop that takes you into the inner depths of the Ministik, eventually passing the Ministik Firetower.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/002-few-to-fire-tower/</guid>
      <description>This route offers an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; starting point for one of the &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; Ministik hikes: a trek to the Ministik Firetower. The route is more &amp;ldquo;direct,&amp;rdquo; but it is decidedly &amp;ldquo;rustic,&amp;rdquo; taking you through long stretches of hay fields until you reach the Waskahegan Trail leading to the tower.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/003-few-to-uofa-gate/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is a perfect &amp;ldquo;mid-level&amp;rdquo; option for those who have some Ministik experience under their belt. It takes you through a long string of connected hay meadows until you reach a section of the Waskahegan Trail and eventually the U of A Access Road.</description>

      <title>Mandy Lake Parking to Old Shelter</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hikes/027-mandy-lake-to-shelter/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/027-mandy-lake-to-shelter/</guid>
      <description>This hike takes you along a former road, a rare thing in the Ministik. The going is easy, the navigation simple, which makes this a perfect choice for a starter hike. The final destination is a shelter that has seen better days, but still provides a roof and a place to rest for a while.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/028-mandy-lake-tr-to-oliver-lake/</guid>
      <description>This hike has all sorts of types of terrain to navigate: it starts out on a road, transitions to a fairly good trail, and ends in a meadow that you’ll need to navigate without the help of a trail. But the end goal will take you to the shoreline of a quiet lake decidedly away from civilization.</description>

      <title>Misasin Trail</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/017-misasin-trail/</guid>
      <description>The trail name &amp;ldquo;Misasin&amp;rdquo; was coined by local geocachers. In Plains Cree, it means &amp;ldquo;rather large, but not overly large.&amp;rdquo; Consider this &amp;ldquo;out-and-back&amp;rdquo; style hike an exploratory trek rather than a leisurely stroll along a well-defined trail. There is only one long &amp;ldquo;leg&amp;rdquo; to this trail plan because the trail as marked is usually quite easy to follow; what lies beyond, not so much. The trail is seldom travelled and can get quite overgrown, especially during the summer months.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/022-mitchell-loop/</guid>
      <description>This hike is a combination of wide, easy trails punctuated with short crossings of trailless meadows in a seldom-travelled corner of the Ministik. Take a short detour to visit one of the few old structures in the Ministik: the Mitchell Cabin.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/036-north-of-502/</guid>
      <description>This somewhat awkwardly named hike takes you into a secluded set of trails not too far from parking. There are a couple of overgrown areas to traverse on the way, but otherwise trails are usually kept clear by local quad traffic.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/005-stick-to-the-road/</guid>
      <description>This hike is all about easy navigation: you follow a road for the entire hike—a rare thing in the Ministik. If this is your first time hiking in the area, this is a perfect introductory hike.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/018-stove-lake-to-crossroads/</guid>
      <description>While this hike isn&amp;rsquo;t listed among the &amp;ldquo;Starter Hikes&amp;rdquo; on the site, it is the next best thing. Rather than roads, there is a trail to follow, but the trail is always clear and easy to navigate. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little jaunt to an intersection of trails in what will feel like the middle of nowhere.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/020-stove-lake-to-fairbrother-corner/</guid>
      <description>This hike rates as &amp;ldquo;Expedition&amp;rdquo; for a reason: it&amp;rsquo;s just about 13 km and covers a good portion of the Ministik. It&amp;rsquo;s a convenient &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; option though: the departure and destination trailhead are along the same country road.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/019-stove-lake-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This hike takes you through the heart of the Ministik, on all kinds of trails: some usually clear, some usually dodgy. After traversing a cutline, you’ll take part of the Waskahegan Trail, then make your way to the Nesbit Trail on your way to the Mandy Lake Parking spot</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/006-enchanted-forest-loop/</guid>
      <description>The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/011-waskahegan-trail/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike takes place exclusively on the Waskahegan Trail, the only trail in the Ministik that has trail markings and receives periodic maintenance. There are a couple of rough sections, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively long at 13 km, earning it an &amp;ldquo;Expedition&amp;rdquo; rating on this site.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/010-three-meadows-loop/</guid>
      <description>Like the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop&amp;rdquo;, this hike route takes you from the Waskahegan Trail through three &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows. But beware: the middle section of this hike may look like a sly shortcut compared to the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop,&amp;rdquo; but that shortcut is through perennially dodgy terrain where you’ll need to exercise your route-finding abilities.</description>

      <description>Starting out on the U of A Access Road, and after transitioning to the Waskahegan Trail, this hike takes you to one of the few historical landmarks in the area: the Ministik Firetower. This is a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; hike for someone with some Ministik hiking experience under their belt.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/012-uofa-gate-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; epic hike starts out at the U of A Access Road gate, and traverses both the north and southern Ministik. The first half is on the Waskahegan Trail; the second takes you through some potentially tougher terrain until you reach the established Nesbit Trail. Be aware: this hike will require both stamina and wayfinding abilities and is intended for experienced hikers.</description>

      <description>If the suggested &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; hikes look a little too tame for you, this hike takes you one step further by guiding you off-road, along the Waskahegan Trail, and then looping back through a hay field on your return to a road.</description>

      <description>This hike takes you on seldom-travelled trails, and because of that, many can be overgrown and hard to follow at times. This hike isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the longest on the site, but it ranks as one of the more strenuous because of the number of obstacles you will need to navigate.</description>

      <description>At almost 10 km, this &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike will test your stamina, but the trails themselves should be easy to follow throughout. After spending the first half on the Waskahegan Trail, you transition to a former cutline that is often traversed by sleds in the winter, making it fairly easy to follow.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is an epic expedition that will take you through the heart of the Ministik. You’ll experience easy sections on a road and clear trails, and a series of open meadows where there are no trails. Note the hike’s difficulty rating: it’s one of the most challenging on this site.</description>

      <description>This hike is a perfect starter for many &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hikes listed on this site. This relatively short hike is part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is usually fairly easy to follow. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover,&amp;rdquo; a quaint little hut that welcomes passing hikers.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/040-berg-section-out-and-back/</guid>
      <description>This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as &amp;ldquo;Moderate&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover&amp;rdquo;, a quaint little hut that welcomes passing hikers. The hike is &amp;ldquo;out and back&amp;rdquo; so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started.</description>
