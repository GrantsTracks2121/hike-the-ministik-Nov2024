      <title>Fairbrother Corner Trailhead</title>

      <description>Named for a former nearby land owner, Fairbrother corner provides you with immediate access to the Waskahegan Trail. When you walk past the gate the Waskahegan extends both directly east and directly south. There is ample parking here because there is no ditch to speak of and ample space between the road and the treeline. This means you can easily safely park multiple vehicles off the road.?</description>

      <description>Like the trail, this trailhead seems seldom used, but because it is situated along a quiet road, it offers plenty of parking space in any season. In season, you can pull off the road into the very shallow ditch or simply park as far off the road as possible if snow is factor.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/trailheads/berg-south/</guid>
      <description>The Waskahegan Berg Section - South Trailhead is bit different from other Ministik trailheads in that there is no safe parking at the trailhead itself. But parking is very close nearby at the U of A Access Gate. Once parked near the gate, walk for about 3 minutes west, cross the road and ditch and access the trailhead to start your hike.</description>

      <description>The Stove Lake Trailhead, named after a now completely dried up lake nearby, has best parking space among Ministik trailheads. Situated on a sharp curve the wide, sloped ditch between the road and the trailhead gate allows room for multiple vehicles. Even in winter there‚Äôs room along the road itself to park multiple vehicles safely.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/trailheads/few/</guid>
      <description>This trailhead offers somewhat meager parking: one good-sized car can safely pull off the road and park in front of the gate here. If two people are driving Mini Coopers, then maybe two cars. üòÉ When parking, beware of the steep ditches here. Especially in winter it&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to slide into the ditch where you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need AMA assistance to get you back out.</description>

      <description>The Mandy Lake Road trailhead is well-used in all seasons. Although it is at the end of Township Rd 502, past any local farmyards, it gets maintenance attention in all seasons. There is ample parking along the small pond side of the road. Please don&amp;rsquo;t block the gate even though it is seldom, if ever, used.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs fair to say that the U of A Access Road Gate is the ‚Äúfront door‚Äù of the Ministik. The gated road leads to a former  U of A Research Station and although the facility seems to have been shuttered from many years, the road itself is periodically cleared of deadfall and other obstacles.</description>

      <description>Starting from the U of A Access Road Gate, this hike traverses sections of the established Waskahegan Trail as well as a series of five &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows on a wide loop that takes you into the inner depths of the Ministik, eventually passing the Ministik Firetower.</description>

      <description>This route offers an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; starting point for one of the &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; Ministik hikes: a trek to the Ministik Firetower. The route is more &amp;ldquo;direct,&amp;rdquo; but it is decidedly &amp;ldquo;rustic,&amp;rdquo; taking you through long stretches of hay fields until you reach the Waskahegan Trail leading to the tower.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is a perfect &amp;ldquo;mid-level&amp;rdquo; option for those who have some Ministik experience under their belt. It takes you through a long string of connected hay meadows until you reach a section of the Waskahegan Trail and eventually the U of A Access Road.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/027-mandy-lake-to-shelter/</guid>
      <description>This hike takes you along a former road, a rare thing in the Ministik. The going is easy, the navigation simple, which makes this a perfect choice for a starter hike. The final destination is a shelter that has seen better days, but still provides a roof and perhaps a place to rest for a while.</description>

      <description>This hike has all sorts of types of terrain to navigate: it starts out on a road, transitions to a fairly good trail, and ends in a meadow that you‚Äôll need to navigate without the help of a trail. But the end goal will take you to the shoreline of a quiet lake decidedly away from civilization.</description>

      <description>The trail name &amp;ldquo;Misasin&amp;rdquo; was coined by local geocachers. In Plains Cree, it means &amp;ldquo;rather large, but not overly large.&amp;rdquo; Consider this &amp;ldquo;out-and-back&amp;rdquo; style hike an exploratory trek rather than a leisurely stroll along a well-defined trail. There is only one long &amp;ldquo;leg&amp;rdquo; to this trail plan because the trail as marked is usually quite easy to follow; what lies beyond, not so much. The trail is seldom travelled and can get quite overgrown, especially during the summer months.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a convenient &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; option though: the departure and destination trailhead are along the same country road.</description>

      <description>While this hike isn&amp;rsquo;t listed among the &amp;ldquo;Starter Hikes&amp;rdquo; on the site, it is the next best thing. Rather than roads, there is a trail to follow, but the trail is always clear and easy to navigate. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little jaunt to an intersection of trails in what will feel like the middle of nowhere.</description>

      <description>The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area.</description>

  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;Hiking in the Ministik is unique when compared to other hiking destinations in the area because trails here are largely &lt;strong&gt;unmaintained&lt;/strong&gt;. In the Ministik, nature is almost completely left alone to its &amp;ldquo;naturing&amp;rdquo;. Growth and decay slowly alter the character of trails, often obsuring them with overgrowth in the short run and completely reclaiming them in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike takes place exclusively on the Waskahegan Trail, the only trail in the Ministik that has trail markings and receives periodic maintenance. There are a couple of rough sections, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively long at 13 km, earning it an &amp;ldquo;Expedition&amp;rdquo; rating on this site.</description>

      <description>Like the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop&amp;rdquo;, this hike route takes you from the Waskahegan Trail through three &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows. But beware: the middle section of this hike may look like a sly shortcut compared to the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop,&amp;rdquo; but that shortcut is through perennially dodgy terrain where you‚Äôll need to exercise your route-finding abilities.</description>

      <description>Starting out on the U of A Access Road, and after transitioning to the Waskahegan Trail, this hike takes you to one of the few historical landmarks in the area: the Ministik Firetower. This is a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; hike for someone with some Ministik hiking experience under their belt.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/012-uofa-gate-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; epic hike starts out at the U of A Access Road gate, and traverses both the north and southern Ministik. The first half is on the Waskahegan Trail; the second takes you through some potentially tougher terrain until you reach the established Nesbit Trail. Be aware: this hike will require both stamina and wayfinding abilities and is intended for experienced hikers.</description>

      <description>If the suggested &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; hikes look a little too tame for you, this hike takes you one step further by guiding you off-road, along the Waskahegan Trail, and then looping back through a hay field on your return to a road.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/014-uofa-gate-stove-lake-via-deadfall-alley/</guid>
      <description>This hike takes you on seldom-travelled trails, and because of that, many can be overgrown and hard to follow at times. This hike isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the longest on the site, but it ranks as one of the more strenuous because of the number of obstacles you will need to navigate.</description>

      <description>At almost 10 km, this &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike will test your stamina, but the trails themselves should be easy to follow throughout. After spending the first half on the Waskahegan Trail, you transition to a former cutline that is often traversed by sleds in the winter, making it fairly easy to follow.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is an epic expedition that will take you through the heart of the Ministik. You‚Äôll experience easy sections on a road and clear trails, and a series of open meadows where there are no trails. Note the hike‚Äôs difficulty rating: it‚Äôs one of the most challenging on this site.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/004-berg-section-2-car/</guid>
      <description>This hike is a perfect starter for many &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hikes listed on this site. This relatively short hike is part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is usually fairly easy to follow. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover,&amp;rdquo; a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers.</description>

      <title>Waskahegan Berg Section - Out &amp; Back</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/hikes/040-berg-section-out-and-back/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/040-berg-section-out-and-back/</guid>
      <description>This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as &amp;ldquo;Moderate&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover&amp;rdquo;, a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers. The hike is &amp;ldquo;out and back&amp;rdquo; so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started.</description>
