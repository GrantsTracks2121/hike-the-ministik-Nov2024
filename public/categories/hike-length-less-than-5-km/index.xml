      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is a perfect &amp;ldquo;mid-level&amp;rdquo; option for those who have some Ministik experience under their belt. It takes you through a long string of connected hay meadows until you reach a section of the Waskahegan Trail and eventually the U of A Access Road.</description>

      <title>Mandy Lake Parking to Old Shelter</title>

      <description>This hike takes you along a former road, a rare thing in the Ministik. The going is easy, the navigation simple, which makes this a perfect choice for a starter hike. The final destination is a shelter that has seen better days, but still provides a roof and perhaps a place to rest for a while.</description>

      <title>Misasin Trail</title>

      <description>The trail name &amp;ldquo;Misasin&amp;rdquo; was coined by local geocachers. In Plains Cree, it means &amp;ldquo;rather large, but not overly large.&amp;rdquo; Consider this &amp;ldquo;out-and-back&amp;rdquo; style hike an exploratory trek rather than a leisurely stroll along a well-defined trail. There is only one long &amp;ldquo;leg&amp;rdquo; to this trail plan because the trail as marked is usually quite easy to follow; what lies beyond, not so much. The trail is seldom travelled and can get quite overgrown, especially during the summer months.</description>

      <title>The Enchanted Forest Loop</title>

      <description>The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area.</description>

      <description>This hike is a perfect starter for many &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hikes listed on this site. This relatively short hike is part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is usually fairly easy to follow. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover,&amp;rdquo; a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers.</description>
