      <description>This route offers an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; starting point for one of the &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; Ministik hikes: a trek to the Ministik Firetower. The route is more &amp;ldquo;direct,&amp;rdquo; but it is decidedly &amp;ldquo;rustic,&amp;rdquo; taking you through long stretches of hay fields until you reach the Waskahegan Trail leading to the tower.</description>

      <title>Mandy Lake Parking to Old Shelter</title>

      <description>This hike takes you along a former road, a rare thing in the Ministik. The going is easy, the navigation simple, which makes this a perfect choice for a starter hike. The final destination is a shelter that has seen better days, but still provides a roof and a place to rest for a while.</description>

      <description>This hike has all sorts of types of terrain to navigate: it starts out on a road, transitions to a fairly good trail, and ends in a meadow that you’ll need to navigate without the help of a trail. But the end goal will take you to the shoreline of a quiet lake decidedly away from civilization.</description>

      <title>Misasin Trail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hikes/017-misasin-trail/</link>

      <description>The trail name &amp;ldquo;Misasin&amp;rdquo; was coined by local geocachers. In Plains Cree, it means &amp;ldquo;rather large, but not overly large.&amp;rdquo; Consider this &amp;ldquo;out-and-back&amp;rdquo; style hike an exploratory trek rather than a leisurely stroll along a well-defined trail. There is only one long &amp;ldquo;leg&amp;rdquo; to this trail plan because the trail as marked is usually quite easy to follow; what lies beyond, not so much. The trail is seldom travelled and can get quite overgrown, especially during the summer months.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/005-stick-to-the-road/</guid>
      <description>This hike is all about easy navigation: you follow a road for the entire hike—a rare thing in the Ministik. If this is your first time hiking in the area, this is a perfect introductory hike.</description>

      <title>Stove Lake to Crossroads</title>

      <description>While this hike isn&amp;rsquo;t listed among the &amp;ldquo;Starter Hikes&amp;rdquo; on the site, it is the next best thing. Rather than roads, there is a trail to follow, but the trail is always clear and easy to navigate. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little jaunt to an intersection of trails in what will feel like the middle of nowhere.</description>

      <title>Trek to the Ministik Fire Tower</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/008-uofa-to-fire-tower/</guid>
      <description>Starting out on the U of A Access Road, and after transitioning to the Waskahegan Trail, this hike takes you to one of the few historical landmarks in the area: the Ministik Firetower. This is a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; hike for someone with some Ministik hiking experience under their belt.</description>

      <title>Waskahegan Berg Section - Out &amp; Back</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/hikes/040-berg-section-out-and-back/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/hikes/040-berg-section-out-and-back/</guid>
      <description>This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as &amp;ldquo;Moderate&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover&amp;rdquo;, a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers. The hike is &amp;ldquo;out and back&amp;rdquo; so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started.</description>
