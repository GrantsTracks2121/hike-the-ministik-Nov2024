      <description>Starting from the U of A Access Road Gate, this hike traverses sections of the established Waskahegan Trail as well as a series of five &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows on a wide loop that takes you into the inner depths of the Ministik, eventually passing the Ministik Firetower.</description>

      <description>This route offers an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; starting point for one of the &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; Ministik hikes: a trek to the Ministik Firetower. The route is more &amp;ldquo;direct,&amp;rdquo; but it is decidedly &amp;ldquo;rustic,&amp;rdquo; taking you through long stretches of hay fields until you reach the Waskahegan Trail leading to the tower.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is a perfect &amp;ldquo;mid-level&amp;rdquo; option for those who have some Ministik experience under their belt. It takes you through a long string of connected hay meadows until you reach a section of the Waskahegan Trail and eventually the U of A Access Road.</description>

      <description>This hike is all about easy navigation: you follow a road for the entire hike—a rare thing in the Ministik. If this is your first time hiking in the area, this is a perfect introductory hike.</description>

      <title>The Enchanted Forest Loop</title>

      <description>The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area.</description>

      <title>The Waskahegan Trail</title>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike takes place exclusively on the Waskahegan Trail, the only trail in the Ministik that has trail markings and receives periodic maintenance. There are a couple of rough sections, and it&amp;rsquo;s relatively long at 13 km, earning it an &amp;ldquo;Expedition&amp;rdquo; rating on this site.</description>

      <description>Like the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop&amp;rdquo;, this hike route takes you from the Waskahegan Trail through three &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows. But beware: the middle section of this hike may look like a sly shortcut compared to the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop,&amp;rdquo; but that shortcut is through perennially dodgy terrain where you’ll need to exercise your route-finding abilities.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/008-uofa-to-fire-tower/</guid>
      <description>Starting out on the U of A Access Road, and after transitioning to the Waskahegan Trail, this hike takes you to one of the few historical landmarks in the area: the Ministik Firetower. This is a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; hike for someone with some Ministik hiking experience under their belt.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/012-uofa-gate-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; epic hike starts out at the U of A Access Road gate, and traverses both the north and southern Ministik. The first half is on the Waskahegan Trail; the second takes you through some potentially tougher terrain until you reach the established Nesbit Trail. Be aware: this hike will require both stamina and wayfinding abilities and is intended for experienced hikers.</description>

      <description>If the suggested &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; hikes look a little too tame for you, this hike takes you one step further by guiding you off-road, along the Waskahegan Trail, and then looping back through a hay field on your return to a road.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/014-uofa-gate-stove-lake-via-deadfall-alley/</guid>
      <description>This hike takes you on seldom-travelled trails, and because of that, many can be overgrown and hard to follow at times. This hike isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the longest on the site, but it ranks as one of the more strenuous because of the number of obstacles you will need to navigate.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/013-uofa-gate-stove-lake-via-tower/</guid>
      <description>At almost 10 km, this &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike will test your stamina, but the trails themselves should be easy to follow throughout. After spending the first half on the Waskahegan Trail, you transition to a former cutline that is often traversed by sleds in the winter, making it fairly easy to follow.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/034-uofa-gate-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike is an epic expedition that will take you through the heart of the Ministik. You’ll experience easy sections on a road and clear trails, and a series of open meadows where there are no trails. Note the hike’s difficulty rating: it’s one of the most challenging on this site.</description>
