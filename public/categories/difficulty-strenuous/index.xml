      <description>This route offers an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; starting point for one of the &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; Ministik hikes: a trek to the Ministik Firetower. The route is more &amp;ldquo;direct,&amp;rdquo; but it is decidedly &amp;ldquo;rustic,&amp;rdquo; taking you through long stretches of hay fields until you reach the Waskahegan Trail leading to the tower.</description>

      <description>This hike takes you through the heart of the Ministik, on all kinds of trails: some usually clear, some usually dodgy. After traversing a cutline, you’ll take part of the Waskahegan Trail, then make your way to the Nesbit Trail on your way to the Mandy Lake Parking spot</description>

      <description>Starting out on the U of A Access Road, and after transitioning to the Waskahegan Trail, this hike takes you to one of the few historical landmarks in the area: the Ministik Firetower. This is a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo; hike for someone with some Ministik hiking experience under their belt.</description>

      <description>This hike takes you on seldom-travelled trails, and because of that, many can be overgrown and hard to follow at times. This hike isn&amp;rsquo;t one of the longest on the site, but it ranks as one of the more strenuous because of the number of obstacles you will need to navigate.</description>

      <description>At almost 10 km, this &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hike will test your stamina, but the trails themselves should be easy to follow throughout. After spending the first half on the Waskahegan Trail, you transition to a former cutline that is often traversed by sleds in the winter, making it fairly easy to follow.</description>
