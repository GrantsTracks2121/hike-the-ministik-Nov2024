      <description>Starting from the U of A Access Road Gate, this hike traverses sections of the established Waskahegan Trail as well as a series of five &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows on a wide loop that takes you into the inner depths of the Ministik, eventually passing the Ministik Firetower.</description>

      <description>This hike is a combination of wide, easy trails punctuated with short crossings of trailless meadows in a seldom-travelled corner of the Ministik. Take a short detour to visit one of the few old structures in the Ministik: the Mitchell Cabin.</description>

      <title>North of Township Road 502 Loop</title>

      <description>This somewhat awkwardly named hike takes you into a secluded set of trails not too far from parking. There are a couple of overgrown areas to traverse on the way, but otherwise trails are usually kept clear by local quad traffic.</description>

      <title>The Enchanted Forest Loop</title>

      <description>The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area.</description>

      <title>Three Meadows Loop</title>

      <description>Like the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop&amp;rdquo;, this hike route takes you from the Waskahegan Trail through three &amp;ldquo;off-trail&amp;rdquo; hay meadows. But beware: the middle section of this hike may look like a sly shortcut compared to the &amp;ldquo;Five Meadows Loop,&amp;rdquo; but that shortcut is through perennially dodgy terrain where you’ll need to exercise your route-finding abilities.</description>

      <title>UofA Access Road Gate to Mandy Lake Parking</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/hikes/012-uofa-gate-to-mandy-lake/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; epic hike starts out at the U of A Access Road gate, and traverses both the north and southern Ministik. The first half is on the Waskahegan Trail; the second takes you through some potentially tougher terrain until you reach the established Nesbit Trail. Be aware: this hike will require both stamina and wayfinding abilities and is intended for experienced hikers.</description>

      <description>If the suggested &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; hikes look a little too tame for you, this hike takes you one step further by guiding you off-road, along the Waskahegan Trail, and then looping back through a hay field on your return to a road.</description>
