      <description>This hike is a perfect starter for many &amp;ldquo;2-Car&amp;rdquo; hikes listed on this site. This relatively short hike is part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is usually fairly easy to follow. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover,&amp;rdquo; a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers.</description>

      <title>Waskahegan Berg Section - Out &amp; Back</title>

      <description>This hike is a perfect starter hike on a somewhat secluded trail that is usually in good shape. The route is rated as &amp;ldquo;Moderate&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s a little longer than other starter hikes. This is a part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is periodically maintained and marked. It features the opportunity to visit &amp;ldquo;Berg Stopover&amp;rdquo;, a quaint little hut built on private land that welcomes passing hikers. The hike is &amp;ldquo;out and back&amp;rdquo; so the idea is walk the length of trail and then double back to the parking spot where you started.</description>
