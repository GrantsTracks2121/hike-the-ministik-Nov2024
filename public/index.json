In Plains Cree, it means \u0026ldquo;rather large, but not overly large.\u0026rdquo; Consider this \u0026ldquo;out-and-back\u0026rdquo; style hike an exploratory trek rather than a leisurely stroll along a well-defined trail. There is only one long \u0026ldquo;leg\u0026rdquo; to this trail plan because the trail as marked is usually quite easy to follow; what lies beyond, not so much. The trail is seldom travelled and can get quite overgrown, especially during the summer months. Mandy Lake Parking to Old Shelter This hike takes you along a former road, a rare thing in the Ministik. The going is easy, the navigation simple, which makes this a perfect choice for a starter hike. The final destination is a shelter that has seen better days, but still provides a roof and a place to rest for a while. The Enchanted Forest Loop The majority of this hike is along the U of A Field Station Access Road, but instead of remaining on the road the entire time, it takes you on a short section of the Waskahegan Trail, loops through a small forested area, and returns to the road. This is a nice introduction to the quiet, understated beauty of this area. Waskahegan Berg Section - 2 Car This hike is a perfect starter for many \u0026ldquo;2-Car\u0026rdquo; hikes listed on this site. This relatively short hike is part of the Waskahegan Trail and, as such, is usually fairly easy to follow.

There are a couple of overgrown areas to traverse on the way, but otherwise trails are usually kept clear by local quad traffic. Mandy Lake Parking to Oliver Lake East This hike has all sorts of types of terrain to navigate: it starts out on a road, transitions to a fairly good trail, and ends in a meadow that you’ll need to navigate without the help of a trail. But the end goal will take you to the shoreline of a quiet lake decidedly away from civilization. Mitchell Loop This hike is a combination of wide, easy trails punctuated with short crossings of trailless meadows in a seldom-travelled corner of the Ministik.

This indicates quantity, but not necessarily quality. 😃 Browse the hikes from mulitiple trailheads to find those that match both your urge for exploration and your fitness level.\n\u0026nbsp;\nThis list doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet include all Ministik trailheads. Future additions are planned. U of A Field Station Access Road Gate It’s fair to say that the U of A Access Road Gate is the “front door” of the Ministik. The gated road leads to a former U of A Research Station. The facility seems to have been shuttered from many years, but the road itself is periodically cleared of deadfall and other obstacles. Francis Edward Williams Trailhead This trailhead offers somewhat meager parking: one good-sized car can safely pull off the road and park in front of the gate here. If two people are driving Mini Coopers, then maybe two cars. 😃 When parking, beware of the steep ditches here. Especially in winter it\u0026rsquo;s all too easy to slide into the ditch where you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need AMA assistance to get you back out. Stove Lake Trailhead The Stove Lake Trailhead, named after a now completely dried up lake nearby, has best parking space among Ministik trailheads. Situated on a sharp curve the wide, sloped ditch between the road and the trailhead gate allows room for multiple vehicles. Even in winter there’s room along the road itself to park multiple vehicles safely. Waskahegan Berg Section - South Trailhead The Waskahegan Berg Section - South Trailhead is bit different from other Ministik trailheads in that there is no safe parking at the trailhead itself. But parking is very close nearby at the U of A Access Gate. Once parked near the gate, walk for about 3 minutes west, cross the road and ditch and access the trailhead to start your hike. Mandy Lake Road Trailhead The Mandy Lake Road trailhead is well-used in all seasons. Although it is at the end of Township Rd 502, past any local farmyards, it gets maintenance attention in all seasons. There is ample parking along the small pond side of the road. Please don\u0026rsquo;t block the gate even though it is seldom, if ever, used. Fairbrother Corner Trailhead Named for a former nearby land owner, Fairbrother corner provides you with immediate access to the Waskahegan Trail. When you walk past the gate the Waskahegan extends both directly east and directly south. There is ample parking here because there is no ditch to speak of and ample space between the road and the treeline. This means you can easily safely park multiple vehicles off the road.? Misasin Trailhead Like the trail, this trailhead seems seldom used, but because it is situated along a quiet road, it offers plenty of parking space in any season. In season, you can pull off the road into the very shallow ditch or simply park as far off the road as possible if snow is a factor.

In the Ministik, nature is almost completely left alone to its \u0026ldquo;naturing\u0026rdquo;. Growth and decay slowly alter the character of trails, often obsuring them with overgrowth in the short run and completely reclaiming them in the long run.\nThis lack of trail maintenance gives the place a \u0026ldquo;wild\u0026rdquo; character, which means it can be unpredictable. That may be a reason for many people to avoid the area, especially if the goal is an easy, leisurely stroll without having to pay heed to navigating a hiking route.\nThis same unpredictability may also be the very reason for others to be keen to hike the area because with it brings a real sense of exploration, discovery and a feeling of experiencing nature that has not been molded to any large extent by humans.\nThe goal of this site is to suggest hiking routes in the Ministik, but also to give some kind of idea about what trail conditions you can expect on the hikes. That\u0026rsquo;s where the site\u0026rsquo;s Trail Rating System comes in. Difficulty values and descriptors have been determined to you can make an informed choice about what hikes might be best for you, given your physical and route-finding abilities.\nThe Waskahegan Trail # The notable and welcome exception to the general absence of trail maintenance in the Ministik is the Waskahegan Trail which arcs through a large portion of the Ministik. The Waskahegan is periodically maintained by the Waskahegan Trail Association . This means deadfall and bush obstructing the trail is removed periodically and the trail is marked making it easier to follow.

There are a couple of rough sections, and it\u0026rsquo;s relatively long at 13 km, earning it an \u0026ldquo;Expedition\u0026rdquo; rating on this site.","title":"The Waskahegan Trail","type":"hikes"},{"content":" Why a Trail Rating System? # The color of each leg of a route displays its relative difficulty When hiking in on an established, maintained hiking trail you expect to be able walk on trails that are fairly uniform, mostly unobstructed by deadfall and growth on the trail and even find the occasional navigational signage along the way.\nWith the exception of the Waskahegan Trail, the trails in the Ministik provide none of these things. For that reason, someone new to the area should at at least have some idea of what they\u0026rsquo;re getting themselves into when deciding on an outing in the area.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where the trail rating system on this site comes in. It is meant to give you an indication of the combined navigational and physical effort you can expect when walking the trail.\nEach leg as been rated by the expected level of difficulty based on past experience hiking the trail and assigned a color to represent the usual trail conditions for that leg. Each level of difficulty has in turn been assigned a weighting from 1 to 2.5 to show the increased navigational and / or physical effort required to undertake the hike compared to other hikes on the site.\nTrail Rating Categories and Associated Difficulty Weighted Values # The levels of difficulty and weightings are:\nBrown - A road, so the going is easy and the route is always clear. (Weighted 1) Green - Usually a well-defined trail, occasionally overgrown. (Weighted 1.5) Blue - Trail often degraded or overgrown, therefore not well-defined. (Weighted 2) Black - No trail, so navigation is more difficult, yet sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a game trail to follow. (Weighted 2.5) How Route Difficulty Ratings Are Calculated # The length of the route legs in meters is multiplied by the assigned difficulty weighting to come up with a total difficulty for that leg. The difficulty scores for each leg are totalled giving a difficulty rating for the entire hike. That total is then divided by 100 to yield a more manageable number.\nFor example,\nWalking 500 m on a road (Brown, weighted 1) would yield a difficulty score for the leg of (1 x 500) = 500. Walking 500 m where there is no trail (Black, weighted 2.5) would yield a difficulty score of (2.5 x 500) = 1250 The lengths of a legs are the same, but different trail conditions yield different scores giving a hiker some sense of the effort that might be required to walk the leg.\nHow Difficulty Rating Descriptors are Determined # In an effort to help with the comparison of the many route options on the site, descriptors: \u0026ldquo;Easy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Moderate\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Strenous\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Expedition\u0026rdquo; are assigned to routes based on their total ratings.\nA hiking route\u0026rsquo;s difficulty rating score is divided by the highest hike difficulty rating on the site, currently 223. The result is assigned a descriptor based on this table:\n- \u0026lt; .25 = Easy - \u0026gt;= .25 and \u0026lt;=.5 = Moderate - \u0026gt;= .5 and \u0026lt;= .75 = Strenuous - \u0026gt;.75 = Expedition It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see these descriptors are subjective: one person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Strenuous\u0026rdquo; may be another person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Moderate\u0026rdquo;. But the descriptors are provided to give hikers at least some idea of what level of effort the hike will likely entail.\nA Disclaimer About Trail Ratings # As just mentioned about the descriptors, the rating system as a whole is HIGHLY subjective. How highly subjective? Well, put your hand over your head and get on your tippy toes: that highly subjective. 😃\nHave you noticed that when nature is left alone it has a way of changing the landscape any way it sees fit? Likewise, nature is constantly changing the trail conditions in the Ministik, both throughout the seasons in one year and over multiple years. That makes the ratings on this site only \u0026ldquo;best guesses\u0026rdquo; based on the experience of having walked the trails in the past. And of course the ratings only have meaning when compared to the ratings of other hikes on the site.\nAll that said, if you are unfamiliar with the area, the trail difficulty rating of does serve as an indicator (however fuzzy it might be) based on experiences of hiking the actual trails.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/trail-rating-system/","section":"Hike the Ministik!","summary":"The site\u0026rsquo;s trail rating system is meant to give hikers an idea of the navigational difficulty and physical effort it may require to undertake the hike.","title":"This Site's Trail Rating System","type":"page"},{"content":" Hike route: Three Meadows Loop Hike Details Trailhead: UofA Access Road Gate Hike Length: 12.8 km Route Type: Loop Difficulty: Rated 168: Expedition 168\u0026nbsp;/\u0026nbsp;223 ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/hikes/010-three-meadows-loop/","section":"Hikes","summary":"Like the \u0026ldquo;Five Meadows Loop\u0026rdquo;, this hike route takes you from the Waskahegan Trail through three \u0026ldquo;off-trail\u0026rdquo; hay meadows.
