What did I do to change the font of the site title?

in assets/css/custom.css

Added downloading of Rocksalt font
made "RockSalted" class

edited /layouts/partials/header/basic.html
basic.html seems to be called by the other header options, so changing once here affects the rest - I THINK.

to in style the site title

            {{ if not .Site.Params.disableTextInHeader | default true }}
            <a href="{{ "" | relLangURL }}" class="text-base font-medium text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-900 RockSalted">{{
                .Site.Title | markdownify
                }}</a>
            {{ end }}

This works for the desktop version but not mobile

Okay I think I'm on to something - 

https://blowfish.page/docs/advanced-customisation/#using-additional-fonts

Says you put the ttf file in your site
You put the ttf file (for me RockSalt-Regular.ttf) in static/fonts
create the fonts folder if you have to.

I've done that - and see I was already calling the font from that folder and the RockSalted class worked anyway. HOW is that?
