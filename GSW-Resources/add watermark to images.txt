try

create a new directory to hold the results -- the input names will be used for the output

change directory to the directory holding the input

move the watermark to another directory
CODE: SELECT ALL

magick mogrify  -path path_to/new_directory -draw "image over 0,0 0,0 'path_to/water.png'" *.png
supply your actual path to the output directory and the path to the water.png image.

I am not sure you can use -tile in magick mogrify or even in magick. So you may need to tile out the water.png image as desired first and then use magick or magick composite in a script loop for each image you want to watermark.

If you post links to your input and water.png images, we can show you examples.
